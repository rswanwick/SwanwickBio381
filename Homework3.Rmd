```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

1. Transform an excel style data frame turn into a what you need for a .csv file. 

```
Find: \s{2,}
Replace: ,
```
I used the /s to remove any spaces and then the {2} to remove any spaces that we greater than 2. I then replaced the spaces with a comma.

2. To reformat a list of names and institutions so commas are removed from the names and institutions are in parenthesis. 

```
Find:(\w+),\s(\w+),\s(.*)
Replace:\1 \2 (\3)
```

I used the first (\w+) to capture the first part of the name and put it in parenthesis so it was something that I wanted to keep.  I then put the ,\s which captured the comma and the space which I wanted to remove.  Followed by the next (\w+) to capture the next word and repeated the same ,\s to remove the next comma and space. Lastly I put (.*) to capture the final word.  In the replace I added back in the spaces and added the parenthesis so I had the final output that I wanted.

3. To create new lines between each of the names of songs. 

```
Find:(.mp3)\s
Replace:\1\n
```

I selected each of the .mp3 file names as items that I wanted to keep and also selected the spaces.  In the replace I kept the mp3 file names and replaced the space with an enter and this put each of the song names on new lines. 

4. Want to grab the 4 digit code and move it to the end of the song title. 

```
Find:(\d{4})(.+)(.mp3)
Replace:
```
